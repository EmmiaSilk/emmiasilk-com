Skullheart Seekers is a work-in-progress tabletop RPG inspired by the
[Skullgirls](https://skullgirls.com/) fighting game.
The system is heavily combat-focused, and built around the use of d10 dice.
Attacks have both active offense and active defense, and the initiative system
allows for flexible turn orders.

## Initiative
At the start of every round of combat, each player and NPC rolls a number of
d10 action dice, which are kept in their action dice pool until they are used
or until the end of the round. Over the course of the round, the game tick
counts down from 10 to 1. If a character or NPC has an action die in their pool
of a number greater than or equal to the current tick, they can spend that die
to take a turn.

## Taking Your Turn
Characters begin their turn with a set number of action points which they spend
to use actions. Players start with 5. Most basic actions such as a basic attack
or movement cost 2 action points, but everyone has access to unique abilities
which may cost more.

## Attack and Defense
When a combatant attacks their opponent, they roll a die, which is added
to both the accuracy and might of the attack. The target then may either block
or evade, rolling 1d10 for either choice. Blocking guarantees that the damage
is reduced, but also guarantees taking at least one point of damage. Evading
gives the chance to avoid taking damage entirely, but the cost of failure is
taking full damage from the hit.

## Drama Points
Over the course of a battle, characters will generate Drama points. Everyone
has the ability to gain 1 drama point whenever they successfully evade an
attack, but important characters such as player characters also have their own
unique conditions under which they might generate drama. Drama can be traded in
for Action Points at a 1:1 ratio, or may be used as a resource cost for special
actions called Blockbusters. Drama points go away at the end of combat, so be
sure to use them to your advantage.
