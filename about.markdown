Hello! My name is Emmia Silk, and I'm a generalist.
My primary interest is in creating games (including computer games and
tabletop role-playing games), but I learn any skills that I think are necessary
to create something cool. I love making something new to experience with others.

My main tools for graphic design are Krita and Inkscape, which I have used to
make cards and character sheets for tabletop games. I designed the art plate
for my BNB fight stick using free-to-use assets and art I commissioned, and I
created title cards and posters for my online tabletop RPG games.

I'm always working on different projects that require learning new skills.
Some day I hope to create something everyone can enjoy. Until then I will
keep on creating.
